## Potential Vectors if security Headers are not configured

<details>
  <summary>Click for Details</summary>

If the recommended security headers (`X-Frame-Options` and `X-Content-Type-Options`) are not configured on your Apache server, several security vulnerabilities can be exploited. Here's a breakdown of the potential attacks and their implications:

### 1. **Clickjacking Attacks**
- **Header**: `X-Frame-Options`
- **Risk**: Without the `X-Frame-Options` header, your website can be embedded in a frame or iframe on another site. Malicious actors can use this technique, known as clickjacking, to trick users into clicking on elements that appear to be on their site but are actually on another site, potentially leading to unintended actions such as liking a page, making a purchase, or changing their password.

### 2. **MIME Sniffing Attacks**
- **Header**: `X-Content-Type-Options`
- **Risk**: Without the `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header, browsers might try to infer the MIME type of a resource, overriding the server-specified `Content-Type` header. This can allow an attacker to upload a malicious file with a disguised MIME type (like a disguised executable file with a `.jpg` extension) that the browser executes. This vulnerability can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks and other types of code execution vulnerabilities.

### 3. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
- **Related Headers**: Both headers indirectly help prevent XSS:
  - **`X-Frame-Options`**: By preventing your site from being framed, it reduces the attack surface for XSS attacks that rely on framing techniques.
  - **`X-Content-Type-Options`**: Prevents script execution from non-script MIME types, reducing the possibility of XSS exploits via MIME type confusion.

### 4. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
- **Related Headers**: Mainly `X-Frame-Options`
- **Risk**: While primarily defended against by other means (like CSRF tokens), clickjacking can be part of a CSRF attack where an attacker tricks a user into executing unwanted actions on a web application in which they are authenticated. If an application can be framed, it might be possible to engineer a clickjacking attack that also doubles as a CSRF exploit.

### 5. **Code Injection**
- **Related Headers**: Mainly `X-Content-Type-Options`
- **Risk**: Allowing the browser to sniff MIME types can lead to unexpected script execution when files with ambiguous extensions or content are interpreted as executable code, leading to potential malicious code injections.

### 6. **Information and Identity Theft**
- **Related Headers**: Both headers
- **Risk**: Through clickjacking, attackers could potentially redirect users to malicious websites or overlay transparent frames to capture keystrokes and sensitive information. 

### Conclusion
Implementing these headers is a straightforward but crucial aspect of securing web applications. It helps ensure that content is displayed as intended, without unwanted manipulation, and prevents the browser from making potentially dangerous assumptions about the data it handles. By configuring these headers, you significantly reduce the risk of these types of web attacks, enhancing the overall security posture of your application.

## How to use Vim for modifying the config file

<details>
  <summary>Click for Details</summary>

Using `vim` to modify the `apache2.conf` on Metasploitable2 requires a few steps to navigate and edit this crucial configuration file. Here are detailed instructions to ensure you configure Apache securely using `vim`.

### Accessing the Apache Configuration File

1. **Open Terminal**:
   Open your terminal on Metasploitable2.

2. **Navigate to Apache’s Configuration Directory**:
   Apache’s main configuration file, `apache2.conf`, typically resides in `/etc/apache2/`. Change to this directory by running:
   ```bash
   cd /etc/apache2/
   ```

3. **Open the Configuration File**:
   Use `vim` to open the `apache2.conf` file:
   ```bash
   sudo vim apache2.conf
   ```

### Editing with Vim

Here’s a quick rundown on how to use `vim`:

- **Enter Insert Mode**: Press `i` to switch to insert mode where you can start editing the file.
- **Navigate**: Use arrow keys to move around in the file.
- **Add Configuration**:
  - To prevent clickjacking, locate a suitable section or add at the end:
    ```apache
    Header always append X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN
    ```
  - To prevent MIME type sniffing:
    ```apache
    Header set X-Content-Type-Options nosniff
    ```
  - To disable ETag headers:
    ```apache
    FileETag None
    ```
  - To restrict HTTP methods, find the appropriate `<Directory>` section or add one if necessary:
    ```apache
    <Directory /var/www/>
       Order Deny,Allow
       Deny from all
       Allow from all
       <LimitExcept GET POST>
           Deny from all
       </LimitExcept>
    </Directory>
    ```
- **Save and Exit**:
  - To save the changes and exit vim, press `Esc` to leave insert mode, then type:
    ```bash
    :wq
    ```
  - To exit without saving changes, type:
    ```bash
    :q!
    ```

### Restart Apache to Apply Changes

After editing the configuration file, restart Apache to apply the changes:
```bash
sudo service apache2 restart
```
or if that service command is not available:
```bash
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
```

### Confirming Changes

After restarting Apache, it's a good idea to confirm that the headers have been applied correctly. You can check headers from another terminal or machine using `curl`:
```bash
curl -I http://localhost
```
or replace `localhost` with the Metasploitable2 IP address if accessing from another machine. This command should show the headers being applied as per your configuration.

This guide assumes basic familiarity with vim and command-line operations. If vim feels overwhelming, consider practicing with vim tutorials online, such as `vimtutor`, which is an excellent resource for beginners.

Navigating and searching within `vim` can greatly enhance your efficiency while editing configuration files or scripts. Here are the commands to search for a word, and to quickly move to the top or bottom of a file in `vim`:

### Searching for a Word in Vim

1. **Enter Command Mode**:
   - Press `Esc` to ensure you are in command mode, where you can enter commands directly.

2. **Search for a Word**:
   - To search for a word, type `/` followed by the word you want to search for, and then press `Enter`. For example, to search for "Server", you would type:
     ```
     /Server
     ```
   - Vim will jump to the first occurrence of "Server" below the cursor.

3. **Navigate Through Matches**:
   - To find the next occurrence of the word, press `n`.
   - To find the previous occurrence, press `N`.

### Moving to the Top or Bottom of the File

1. **Move to the Top of the File**:
   - Press `gg` (double `g`). This command will quickly move the cursor to the first line of the file.

2. **Move to the Bottom of the File**:
   - Press `G` (uppercase `g`). This command will move the cursor to the last line of the file.

### Additional Useful Vim Commands

- **Go to a Specific Line**:
  - If you know the line number you want to navigate to, you can type the line number followed by `G`. For example, typing `50G` will take you to line 50.

- **Center the Screen on Your Current Line**:
  - Press `zz` (lowercase `zz`). This will center the screen on the line where your cursor is located.

- **Search Backward**:
  - Similar to searching forward with `/`, you can search backward by using `?`. For example:
    ```
    ?Server
    ```
    This will search for "Server" above the cursor.

### Searching and Replacing

If you find yourself needing to replace words or phrases:

- **Basic Replace Command**:
  - To replace the first instance of a word on each line, use the `:s` command. For example, to replace the first instance of "old" with "new" on the current line:
    ```
    :s/old/new/
    ```
- **Global Replace on the Entire File**:
  - To replace all instances in the entire file, you can add `%` and `g` to the command:
    ```
    :%s/old/new/g
    ```

These commands make `vim` a powerful tool for navigating and editing text files, especially configuration files where specific settings might need to be changed, added, or removed frequently.

## Scanning DVWA with Nikto on Kali and what the results say

<details>
  <summary>Click for Details</summary>

To run a scan on Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) from your Kali Linux system, you can use tools like Nikto for vulnerability scanning or sqlmap for SQL injection testing. Below, I’ll guide you through the steps for both tools.

### Scanning DVWA with Nikto

Nikto is a web server scanner which can perform comprehensive tests against web servers for multiple items, including over 6700 potentially dangerous files/CGIs, checks for outdated versions of over 1250 servers, and version-specific problems on over 270 servers.

**Steps to run Nikto:**

1. **Open your Terminal:**
   - Access the terminal by pressing `Ctrl + Alt + T` or by searching for "Terminal" in your applications menu.

2. **Command to Run Nikto:**
   - Type the following command to start scanning DVWA:
     ```bash
     nikto -h http://localhost/DVWA
     ```
   - Replace `http://localhost/DVWA` with the actual URL if DVWA is hosted on a different IP or port.

3. **Review the Results:**
   - Nikto will output any vulnerabilities or misconfigurations directly to the terminal.
   - Analyze the results to understand the vulnerabilities found.

### Scanning DVWA with sqlmap for SQL Injection

sqlmap is an open source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws and taking over database servers.

**Steps to run sqlmap:**

1. **Identify a Target URL:**
   - You need a URL to test SQL injection, typically where form inputs are processed. For DVWA, this could be a URL like `http://localhost/DVWA/vulnerabilities/sqli`.

2. **Command to Run sqlmap:**
   - Launch sqlmap with a command like:
     ```bash
     sqlmap -u "http://localhost/DVWA/vulnerabilities/sqli/?id=1" --batch --risk=3 --level=5
     ```
   - Replace the URL with the correct one from your DVWA instance. Ensure you have the right parameter (`id` in this case) to test.

3. **Review the Results:**
   - sqlmap will provide detailed output about the SQL injection testing, including database name, tables, columns, and sometimes even data in the database.

### Additional Considerations

- **Set DVWA Security to Low:**
   - For these tools to perform effectively, ensure DVWA’s security level is set to low. This setting is in the DVWA security settings accessible from the DVWA main page.

- **Permissions and Authentication:**
   - If the tools need authenticated access, you might need to configure cookies or session data to allow the scanner to authenticate properly.

- **Legal and Ethical Use:**
   - Ensure you have authorization to perform scans and tests. Unauthorized scanning can be illegal and unethical.

The results of your Nikto scan on the Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) provide several insights into potential security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. Here's a breakdown of the findings:

### 1. Missing HTTP Headers
- **X-Frame-Options**: This header is not present, which means that this site could be vulnerable to clickjacking attacks. Clickjacking involves an attacker tricking a user into clicking something different from what the user perceives, potentially revealing confidential information or allowing others to take control of their computer while clicking seemingly innocuous web pages.
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: This header is also missing. Without this header, browsers might try to guess the MIME type of a document and will execute the document if they guess it to be executable. This can lead to XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks.

### 2. Server and Directory Information
- **Apache/2.4.58 (Debian)**: The server is running on Apache version 2.4.58 on Debian. While this doesn’t indicate a direct vulnerability, it's crucial to keep the software up-to-date as new patches are released.
- Various directories are found to be indexable, which means that the files and subdirectories within them are listed when there is no index file (like index.html). This can lead to information disclosure about the file structure and potential access to sensitive files:
  - **/DVWA/config/**
  - **/DVWA/config/js/**
  - **/DVWA/tests/**
  - **/DVWA/database/**
  - **/DVWA/docs/**
  - **/DVWA/login/**
  - **/DVWA/phpmyadmin/**

### 3. Git Repository Exposure
- **.git Exposure**: The presence of .git directories and files (like .git/index, .git/config) being accessible from the web server could potentially expose sensitive information about the source code and its history. An attacker could download the entire repository to analyze it for vulnerabilities, hardcoded secrets, or configuration details.

### 4. PHP Details
- **/DVWA/phpinfo.php**: The presence of a phpinfo() file that is accessible can reveal a wealth of information about the PHP environment, server configuration, and more, which can be useful for an attacker to craft further attacks.

### 5. Docker File Exposure
- **.dockerignore File**: The exposure of .dockerignore file can give an attacker information about patterns of files and directories marked for omission in Docker build contexts, potentially revealing sensitive files that are not included in the build context.

### Action Steps:
- **Headers**: Add the missing HTTP headers (`X-Frame-Options` and `X-Content-Type-Options`) to improve security against common web attacks.
- **Directory Listing**: Disable directory listing on the server to prevent attackers from discovering files and directories.
- **Secure Git**: Ensure that .git directories are not accessible via the web server. This might involve configuring server rules or .htaccess files to deny access to .git paths.
- **Secure PHP Info**: Restrict access to the `phpinfo.php` file as it should not be accessible in a production environment due to the detailed information it provides.
- **Review Docker Files**: Ensure that sensitive information is not inadvertently exposed through Docker configuration files.

To scan your Metasploitable2 instance using Nikto from your Kali Linux system, you will need the IP address of the Metasploitable2 virtual machine, which from your screenshot appears to be `10.0.2.15`. Here's how to proceed with the scan:

### Steps to Run Nikto on Metasploitable2

1. **Open Terminal**:
   - You can do this by pressing `Ctrl + Alt + T` or by searching for "Terminal" in your applications menu on Kali Linux.

2. **Run Nikto**:
   - Use the following command to initiate the Nikto scan against the Metasploitable2 IP:
     ```bash
     nikto -h 10.0.2.15
     ```
   - This command tells Nikto to scan the host located at `10.0.2.15`.

3. **Review the Output**:
   - Nikto will output its findings directly in the terminal. This will include any common vulnerabilities found on the Metasploitable2 server.
   - Look for issues related to server misconfigurations, vulnerable scripts, outdated server software, and potential exposure of sensitive files.

4. **Analyze and Act**:
   - Once the scan is complete, analyze the output to understand the vulnerabilities.
   - Determine which issues are critical and plan for patches or configurations to mitigate these vulnerabilities.

### Additional Options

- **Detailed Scan**:
  You can increase the detail and scope of the scan by using additional options such as:
  ```bash
  nikto -h 10.0.2.15 -Tuning x
  ```
  Replace `x` with numbers 0-9 to specify what types of tests to perform, depending on what you are focusing on (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS, etc.).

- **Port Specification**:
  If Metasploitable2 services run on non-standard ports that you wish to test, you can specify the port with:
  ```bash
  nikto -h 10.0.2.15 -p 8080
  ```
  Replace `8080` with the port number of interest.

### Considerations

- **Permissions**: Make sure you have the right to scan the Metasploitable2 machine. Even though it's a local and intentional vulnerable machine designed for practice, it's good practice to consider the ethics and legality.
- **Network Settings**: Ensure that both your Kali and Metasploitable2 VMs are on the same network or are configured to see each other on your virtual box settings. Typically, setting network adapters to 'Host-Only' or 'Internal Network' will work if you are not using 'Bridged Adapter'.

## How can each of the areas shown in the Kali scan be attacked?

<details>
  <summary>Click for Details</summary>

The Nikto scan results on your Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) have revealed several vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. Let's discuss how each could potentially be exploited:

### 1. **Missing HTTP Headers**

- **X-Frame-Options**:
  - **Attack Type**: Clickjacking
  - **Exploitation**: An attacker can create a malicious web page that frames the vulnerable site and tricks a user into clicking on something that performs actions on their behalf, like changing a password or making a transaction.
  - **Demonstration**: Embed the DVWA page in an `<iframe>` on a malicious page with buttons overlaid to mislead the user.

- **X-Content-Type-Options**:
  - **Attack Type**: MIME Sniffing
  - **Exploitation**: An attacker can serve a script that the browser might execute under the guise of a different MIME type. For example, disguising malicious JavaScript code as an image file that gets executed when loaded by the browser.
  - **Demonstration**: Serve a file with JavaScript code but declare it as an image or another benign type in an environment that ignores the server-provided MIME type.

### 2. **Server and Directory Information**

- **Directory Indexing**:
  - **Attack Type**: Information Disclosure
  - **Exploitation**: An attacker can browse various directories to find sensitive files, backup files, or configuration scripts that could give further access or sensitive data.
  - **Demonstration**: Access these directories through the browser to display their contents and identify potential files for further attacks.

### 3. **Git Repository Exposure**

- **.git Exposure**:
  - **Attack Type**: Repository Cloning
  - **Exploitation**: An attacker can clone the entire repository from the exposed .git directory to analyze the application’s source code offline. This can reveal sensitive information, historical changes, or other vulnerabilities.
  - **Demonstration**: Use tools like GitTools to clone the repository via the exposed .git directory from the web server.

### 4. **PHP Details Exposure**

- **/DVWA/phpinfo.php**:
  - **Attack Type**: Information Disclosure
  - **Exploitation**: An attacker accesses the `phpinfo.php` page to gather detailed information about the server's PHP environment, configuration settings, and installed modules. This information can be used to tailor further attacks.
  - **Demonstration**: Directly access the `phpinfo.php` page and use the information to plan exploits specific to the server's PHP configuration and versions.

### 5. **Docker File Exposure**

- **.dockerignore File**:
  - **Attack Type**: Configuration Disclosure
  - **Exploitation**: Reviewing the `.dockerignore` file can inform an attacker about the structure of Docker deployments and potential files that are considered sensitive (hence ignored during Docker builds). This might help in identifying files that are not included in the Docker image but exist on the server.
  - **Demonstration**: Access the `.dockerignore` file to understand the directory structure and sensitive files, helping to guide further explorations or exploitation attempts.

### Mitigation Strategies:

To defend against these attacks:
- Implement proper HTTP headers for security (e.g., `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`).
- Disable directory listing in the web server's configuration.
- Secure the .git directory either by restricting access through web server configuration or by ensuring it is not uploaded to production environments.
- Restrict access to sensitive files like `phpinfo.php` through access control mechanisms or by removing them from production servers.
- Secure configuration files and ensure files like `.dockerignore` are not accessible from the web.

By understanding these vulnerabilities and potential exploits, you can better secure your applications against common web attacks.

## Reults of Nikto Scan and Findings From DVWA

<details>
  <summary>Click for Details</summary>

The results from your Nikto scan against the Metasploitable2 machine reveal a couple of common vulnerabilities associated with web server configurations. Here's a breakdown of the findings and their potential impact:

### 1. Missing HTTP Headers

- **X-Frame-Options Header Missing**:
  - **Vulnerability**: This header helps protect your website against clickjacking attacks. Without it, attackers can embed your website in a frame on their malicious site, potentially tricking users into interacting with your site in unintended ways.
  - **Impact**: Users could be tricked into executing actions on your site without their knowledge, such as changing their passwords or making transactions.

- **X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing**:
  - **Vulnerability**: This header prevents the browser from interpreting files as a different MIME type than what is specified by the server. Without this header, browsers can MIME-sniff the content and execute non-executable MIME types, leading to XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks.
  - **Impact**: Allows an attacker to perform XSS attacks by uploading specially crafted files that the browser might execute as an executable.

### 2. Server Configuration

- **ETags (Entity Tags) Configuration**:
  - **Vulnerability**: The server's use of ETags can leak inode information through the HTTP headers. Inodes are identifiers for files and directories in UNIX-like operating systems.
  - **Impact**: An attacker can gain insights into the system's file system structure, which could help in designing further attacks or understanding the server setup.

### 3. Allowed HTTP Methods

- **OPTIONS Method Enabled**:
  - **Vulnerability**: By allowing various HTTP methods (GET, POST, OPTIONS, HEAD), particularly OPTIONS, an attacker can discover potential points of interaction with the server that might be vulnerable.
  - **Impact**: OPTIONS method reveals the HTTP methods that the server supports on a particular URL, which can aid an attacker in crafting specially designed requests that could exploit other vulnerabilities.

### Mitigation Strategies

- **Configure HTTP Headers**:
  - **X-Frame-Options**: Set this to "SAMEORIGIN" or "DENY" to prevent your site from being framed by other sites. This can be configured in your Apache or Nginx configuration file.
    ```apache
    Header always append X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN
    ```
  - **X-Content-Type-Options**: Set this to "nosniff" to prevent MIME-sniffing.
    ```apache
    Header set X-Content-Type-Options nosniff
    ```

- **Secure ETags**:
  - Modify the Apache configuration to either not use ETags or configure them not to leak inode information.
    ```apache
    FileETag None
    ```

- **Restrict HTTP Methods**:
  - Restrict the use of HTTP methods to only those necessary for your application. This can be done via server configuration.
    ```apache
    <LimitExcept GET POST>
      Order Deny,Allow
      Deny from all
    </LimitExcept>
    ```

Implementing these mitigations will help secure your server against the vulnerabilities identified in the Nikto scan, enhancing the overall security posture of your system.

The Nikto scan results on your Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) have revealed several vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. Let's discuss how each could potentially be exploited:

### 1. **Missing HTTP Headers**

- **X-Frame-Options**:
  - **Attack Type**: Clickjacking

  - **Demonstration**: Embed the DVWA page in an `<iframe>` on a malicious page with buttons overlaid to mislead the user.

- **X-Content-Type-Options**:
  - **Attack Type**: MIME Sniffing
  - **Exploitation**: An attacker can serve a script that the browser might execute under the guise of a different MIME type. For example, disguising malicious JavaScript code as an image file that gets executed when loaded by the browser.
  - **Demonstration**: Serve a file with JavaScript code but declare it as an image or another benign type in an environment that ignores the server-provided MIME type.

### 2. **Server and Directory Information**

- **Directory Indexing**:
  - **Attack Type**: Information Disclosure
  - **Exploitation**: An attacker can browse various directories to find sensitive files, backup files, or configuration scripts that could give further access or sensitive data.
  - **Demonstration**: Access these directories through the browser to display their contents and identify potential files for further attacks.

### 3. **Git Repository Exposure**

- **.git Exposure**:
  - **Attack Type**: Repository Cloning
  - **Exploitation**: An attacker can clone the entire repository from the exposed .git directory to analyze the application’s source code offline. This can reveal sensitive information, historical changes, or other vulnerabilities.
  - **Demonstration**: Use tools like GitTools to clone the repository via the exposed .git directory from the web server.

### 4. **PHP Details Exposure**

- **/DVWA/phpinfo.php**:
  - **Attack Type**: Information Disclosure
  - **Exploitation**: An attacker accesses the `phpinfo.php` page to gather detailed information about the server's PHP environment, configuration settings, and installed modules. This information can be used to tailor further attacks.
  - **Demonstration**: Directly access the `phpinfo.php` page and use the information to plan exploits specific to the server's PHP configuration and versions.

### 5. **Docker File Exposure**

- **.dockerignore File**:
  - **Attack Type**: Configuration Disclosure
  - **Exploitation**: Reviewing the `.dockerignore` file can inform an attacker about the structure of Docker deployments and potential files that are considered sensitive (hence ignored during Docker builds). This might help in identifying files that are not included in the Docker image but exist on the server.
  - **Demonstration**: Access the `.dockerignore` file to understand the directory structure and sensitive files, helping to guide further explorations or exploitation attempts.

### Mitigation Strategies:

To defend against these attacks:
- Implement proper HTTP headers for security (e.g., `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`).
- Disable directory listing in the web server's configuration.
- Secure the .git directory either by restricting access through web server configuration or by ensuring it is not uploaded to production environments.
- Restrict access to sensitive files like `phpinfo.php` through access control mechanisms or by removing them from production servers.
- Secure configuration files and ensure files like `.dockerignore` are not accessible from the web.

By understanding these vulnerabilities and potential exploits, you can better secure your applications against common web attacks.

### Comprehensive Guide to Securing Apache on Metasploitable2 and Validating From Kali

#### Initial Scan from Kali
Start with a vulnerability scan using Nikto from your Kali machine to establish the security baseline.

**Command**:
```bash
nikto -h 192.168.56.102
```

**Expected Output**:
You should expect warnings about missing security headers such as `X-Frame-Options` and `X-Content-Type-Options`, along with other potential vulnerabilities.

#### Steps to Secure Apache on Metasploitable2

1. **Enable mod_headers Module on Metasploitable2**
   Make sure the `mod_headers` module is enabled, which is necessary for adding HTTP security headers.
   ```bash
   sudo a2enmod headers
   sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
   ```

2. **Update Apache Configuration**
   Modify the Apache configuration to include security headers and restrict HTTP methods.
   ```bash
   sudo vim /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
   ```
   Add the following configurations:
   ```apache
   # Security Headers
   Header always append X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN
   Header set X-Content-Type-Options nosniff
   FileETag None

   # Restrict HTTP Methods
   <Directory /var/www/>
       Order Allow,Deny
       Allow from all
       <LimitExcept GET POST>
           Deny from all
       </LimitExcept>
   </Directory>
   ```

3. **Restart Apache to Apply Changes**
   ```bash
   sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
   ```

#### Validation Steps on Metasploitable2

Check your configurations directly on Metasploitable2:

1. **Check Apache Configuration for Errors**
   ```bash
   apache2ctl configtest
   ```
   Look for the "Syntax OK" confirmation.

2. **Test Headers Locally**
   Use `curl` to verify headers:
   ```bash
   curl -I http://localhost
   ```

   **Expected Headers in Response**:
   - `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`
   - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`

#### Further Validation From Kali

After securing the server, validate the changes from your Kali system to ensure changes are effective network-wide.

1. **Repeat Nikto Scan**
   ```bash
   nikto -h 192.168.56.102
   ```

   **Expected Changes**:
   - No warnings about `X-Frame-Options` or `X-Content-Type-Options`.

2. **Curl Test from Kali**
   Confirm the headers from Kali to ensure they are transmitted correctly over the network:
   ```bash
   curl -I http://192.168.56.102
   ```

   **Expected Headers in Response**:
   - `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`
   - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`

#### Conclusion

Following these steps will effectively implement and verify security headers on your Metasploitable2 system, checked both locally and from Kali Linux. Regular scans with Nikto after any configuration changes will help maintain the server's security posture robustly.

### Script for Security Presentation on Securing Apache on Metasploitable2

---

**[Opening Slide: Title and Introduction]**

**Speaker:**
"Good morning everyone, today we're going to take a 'header' into securing Apache on our good old friend, Metasploitable2. It's more exposed than your Facebook profile in 2007, but fear not, we'll fix that!"

---

**[Slide 2: Initial Vulnerability Assessment]**

**Speaker:**
"First things first, let's see what we're dealing with. We'll start with a Nikto scan from our Kali machine. For those unfamiliar, Nikto is like that one friend who points out all your flaws... but actually helps you fix them."

**Command on screen:**
```bash
nikto -h 192.168.56.102
```

**Speaker:**
"Expect to see some complaints about missing security headers. These headers are like the bouncers of the club, keeping the riff-raff out of our server's business."

---

**[Slide 3: Enabling mod_headers]**

**Speaker:**
"Step one: Enable `mod_headers` on Metasploitable2. This module lets us add those bouncers—uh, I mean, security headers."

**Command on screen:**
```bash
sudo a2enmod headers
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
```

**Speaker:**
"If `mod_headers` isn't enabled, Apache is like a party without bouncers. Anyone and their script can walk in!"

---

**[Slide 4: Configuring Security Headers]**

**Speaker:**
"Let’s add some headers. We'll set `X-Frame-Options` to SAMEORIGIN to prevent clickjacking attacks, and `X-Content-Type-Options` to nosniff to stop MIME type sniffing—because the only thing we want sniffing around are those free conference snacks, am I right?"

**Command on screen:**
```apache
Header always append X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN
Header set X-Content-Type-Options nosniff
FileETag None
```

**Speaker:**
"We’re also going to turn off ETags with `FileETag None` to prevent inode information leaks, because the only leaks we appreciate are memory leaks... Just kidding, we hate those too."

---

**[Slide 5: Restricting HTTP Methods]**

**Speaker:**
"Next, let’s limit the HTTP methods. Because sometimes, you need to tell your server it can't just GET and POST with everyone."

**Command on screen:**
```apache
<Directory /var/www/>
    Order Allow,Deny
    Allow from all
    <LimitExcept GET POST>
        Deny from all
    </LimitExcept>
</Directory>
```

**Speaker:**
"This setup denies all methods except GET and POST. It’s like telling your kids they can only play in the front yard."

---

**[Slide 6: Restarting Apache and Testing]**

**Speaker:**
"Let's restart Apache to apply our changes. It's like rebooting your computer—sometimes, it's the magic fix."

**Command on screen:**
```bash
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
```

**Speaker:**
"Now, we’ll use `curl` to check our headers from within Metasploitable2 and then again from Kali."

**Commands on screen:**
```bash
curl -I http://localhost
curl -I http://192.168.56.102
```

**Speaker:**
"These commands should show our security headers in action, protecting our server one request at a time."

---

**[Closing Slide: Review and Q&A]**

**Speaker:**
"And that’s how you secure Apache on Metasploitable2. Any questions, or is everyone just ready for lunch? Remember, a secure server is like a good joke—it doesn’t need a punchline, just good execution!"
