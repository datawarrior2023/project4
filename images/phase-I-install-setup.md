     ```
     sudo apt-get install apache2 mysql-server php php-mysqli php-gd libapache2-mod-php
     ```

2. **Start Apache and MySQL Services:**
   - Ensure the services are running:
     ```
     sudo systemctl start apache2
     sudo systemctl start mysql
     ```

3. **Download DVWA:**
   - Clone the DVWA repository from GitHub:
     ```
     cd /var/www/html
     sudo git clone https://github.com/digininja/DVWA.git
     ```

4. **Permissions and Configuration:**
   - Change the permissions of the DVWA folder:
     ```
     sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/DVWA
     ```
   - Copy the config file:
     ```
     sudo cp /var/www/html/DVWA/config/config.inc.php.dist /var/www/html/DVWA/config/config.inc.php
     ```

5. **Configure the Database Connection:**
   - Edit the configuration file:
     ```
     sudo nano /var/www/html/DVWA/config/config.inc.php
     ```
   - Update the database connection settings inside the file:
     ```
     $_DVWA[ 'db_user' ] = 'root';
     $_DVWA[ 'db_password' ] = 'p@ssw0rd';  # change this to your MySQL root password
     $_DVWA[ 'db_database' ] = 'dvwa';
     ```

6. **Create DVWA Database:**
   - Log into MySQL:
     ```
     sudo mysql -u root -p
     ```
   - Create the DVWA database:
     ```
     CREATE DATABASE dvwa;
     EXIT;
     ```

7. **Setup DVWA:**
   - Open your browser and navigate to:
     ```
     http://localhost/DVWA/setup.php
     ```
   - Click on the 'Create / Reset Database' button. This will set up the tables needed for DVWA.

8. **Verify DVWA Installation:**
