### Phase III: Analysis & Prevention of Nikto Attacks - Slide and Script Preparation

**Objective:** The focus of this phase is on demonstrating practical methods to mitigate vulnerabilities identified by Nikto scans. This part of the presentation centers around XSS, SQL Injection, and Command Injection remediation techniques, and a practical demonstration using Metasploit2 instead of DVWA to make the scenario more realistic and relevant.

#### Suggested Slide Structure and Content Version I

**Slide 6: Live Demonstration**
- **Title:** Live Remediation and Validation
- **Bullets:**
  - Updating configurations in Metasploit2 to secure headers.
  - Installing necessary modules for header management.
  - Restarting the server and verifying changes via command line.
- **Image Description:** A split-screen showing command line operations on both Kali and Metasploit2.

**Slide 7: Verifying Improvements**
- **Title:** Verifying Security Enhancements
- **Bullets:**
  - Using `curl` to check header changes on Metasploit2 from Kali.
  - Comparing initial and post-remediation Nikto scan results side by side.
- **Image Description:** Comparative screenshots of the `curl` command and Nikto scans before and after remediation.

### Additional Checks and Suggestions for Improvement:

- **Check for Technical Accuracy:** Ensure all commands and steps are up-to-date with current software versions and best practices.
- **Align with BootCon Guidelines:** The demonstration should be clear, engaging, and informative, with technical details accessible for all attendees.
- **Suggestions for Changes:**
  - Include interactive elements or live polling during the demonstration to engage the audience.
  - Provide handouts or supplementary materials with detailed commands or configuration snippets for attendees to follow along or try later.
  - Consider a backup plan in case of technical difficulties during the live demo.

### Presentation Script

**Slide 1: Introduction**
"Welcome back, everyone! Today, we're moving from theory to practice by applying real-world remediations to common vulnerabilities identified by our previous Nikto scans. Remember, in cybersecurity, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure!"

**Slide 2: XSS Remediation**
"Starting with XSS—by implementing Content Security Policies and input sanitization, we can shield our applications from unwanted script injections. Think of CSPs as the bouncers at the club door, only letting in the VIP scripts."

**Slide 3: SQL Injection Prevention**
"For SQL Injection, it's all about clean inputs and strict boundaries. Using parameterized queries is like having a strict guest list at a party—only expected queries get to dance with our database."

**Slide 4: Preventing Command Injection**
"And when it comes to Command Injection, keeping our software updated and minimizing privileges is like ensuring our digital doors are locked at night—no unwanted commands sneaking in!"

**Slide 5: Demonstration Setup**
"Let's put theory into practice. We'll start by confirming our network setup between Kali and Metasploit2, and then proceed with our initial Nikto scan to spot our digital weak spots."

**Slide 6: Live Demonstration**
"Now, watch closely as we fortify our server. We'll tweak Metasploit2's configuration to secure headers and ensure all our digital ducks are in a row. It’s like updating the locks after finding out your keys were copied."

**Slide 7: Verifying Improvements**
"After our updates, we'll use `curl` to check our headers and run another Nikto scan. It’s the equivalent of checking your work after fixing a leak—always a good idea to make sure things are sealed up tight!"
