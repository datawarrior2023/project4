**Steps We'll Take:**  
1. Perform an initial Nikto scan to identify vulnerabilities.
2. Secure Apache by modifying configuration files to add missing headers and restrict methods.
3. Restart Apache and verify changes.
4. Perform a post-configuration Nikto scan to validate the security enhancements.

**Conducting the Nikto Scan and Securing Apache**  
- **Initial Scan:** Run Nikto from Kali Linux targeting the Metasploitable2 Apache server.  
  Command: `nikto -h 192.168.56.102`
- **Security Enhancements:** Modify `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf` to include:
  - `Header always append X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN`
  - `Header set X-Content-Type-Options nosniff`
  - Restrict methods via `<LimitExcept>` directive.
- **Restart Apache:** Use `sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart` to apply changes.
- **Validation Scan:** Re-run Nikto to confirm the mitigation of previous vulnerabilities.
