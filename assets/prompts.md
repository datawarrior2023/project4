### Start of add current research and slides
```text
The presentation is in 4 stages. I am going to give you the first three one at a time for review. Ready?
```

### Adding to Phase I
```text
Add this to Phase I (Covering what Nikto is and what it entails, basically setting the stage). Summarize it and compare the BootCon Presentation Guide and create 2 versions of suggested slides to fullfill the requirments. Keep in mind Phase II - is going to be the Demo and presentation of Nikto ( you don't have yet) OR phase III - Demo and presentation of securing and reducing the attack surface, mitigation (you don't have yet) and Closing slides (you don't have yet and will help build after we get through phase III)
```

### Adding to Phase II
```text
Add this to Phase II. Organize this into intelligent, logical flow that fits into the bootcon guide. Print out the flow with detailed information. Then check it for accuracy and look for any missing information that could be added, then list that after. 
```
#### Create a second version
```text
Create another version. 
```

### Adding to Phase III
```text
Add this to Phase III. Organize this into intelligent, logical flow that fits into the bootcon guide. Print out the flow with detailed information. Then check it for accuracy and look for any missing information that could be added, then list that after. 
```

### Select version or combo and create suggested slide content
```text
Lets use version 1: Add a suggested form for the slides and what it should look like. For example: Summary and bullets and create the example OR maybe a summary and bullets and an image (just describe the image) and create an example OR Bullets with an Image(s) OR just a title and an image(s). After you are done go back through and make sure it is inline with the BootCon Guide and the information is factual and accurate. If any suggestions for changes, add them in a list after. 
```

### Create script
```text
Now create a script to read for the presentation. Make it educational, and so it can be understandable to the non-technical business personnel. include one funny joke. After you are done go back through and make sure it is inline with the BootCon Guide and the information is factual and accurate. If any suggestions for changes, add them in a list after.
